## Introduction
The game is a classic Tamagotchi with clicker elements.

## Description
The player's goal is to monitor the virtual pet's state and maintain it by clicking to restore various indicators, such as Hunger, Dirty, Fatigue, and Sick, which are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Players can also earn coins by clicking on the pet's image. The pet's overall state is measured by the happiness indicator. During the game, the pet automatically gains experience points, leading to level-ups. The higher the pet's happiness level, the faster it gains experience. With each new level, the number of coins earned per click increases.
